# Contributing to Lightstream

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lightstream! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your help!

## Contributor Licence Agreement

By submitting a contribution to this repository, you agree to the Contributor Licence Agreement (`CLA.md`).

Under the CLA, copyright in your contribution is assigned to the project maintainer. Contributors retain a licence to use their contributions under the project’s open-source licence.

This ensures clear and consistent IP ownership and avoids ambiguity when accepting contributions from multiple authors, including cases where the maintainer cannot reasonably verify the original provenance of all submitted code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.89.0-nightly or later
- Git
- Familiarity with Apache Arrow and low-level memory concepts (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lightstream.git
   cd Lightstream
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/Lightstream.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies and run tests. The crate lives under `rust/`, so cargo commands run from there:
   ```bash
   cd rust
   cargo test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes, following the coding standards below
3. Add or update tests as appropriate
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all-features
   ```
or, for exhaustive feature-flag checks (requires cargo install cargo-all-features):
   ```base
   cargo test-all-features
   ```
The second form is recommended for changes that may affect multiple features.
It tests combinations of up to two feature flags and takes about five minutes.

5. Run clippy for linting:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
   ```
6. Format your code:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt
   ```

### Commit Messages

Please use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format:

- `feat: add new array type support`
- `fix: resolve memory alignment issue in Vec64`
- `docs: update API documentation for Table`
- `perf: optimise SIMD operations for integer arrays`
- `test: add benchmarks for categorical arrays`

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Follow standard Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Avoid traits and superfluous abstractions unless they genuinely add value - this is particularly important as LLMs will often suggest these unnecessarily
- Ensure modules, structs and functions contain exactly what they say on the tin
- Brief and informative comments are great. Well-named objects are even better!
- Single-responsibility principle - each function should have one clear purpose
- Avoid code duplication through helper functions and macros where appropriate
- At enum match-arms - it is often preferable for maintability to call into dedicated functions rather than inlining logic per type. 
- Avoid overengineering if it is not adding genuine value to the codebase

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- Use doc comments (`///`) for public functions, structs, and modules
- Include examples in documentation where helpful:
  ```rust
  /// Creates a new IntegerArray from a vector of values.
  ///
  /// # Examples
  ///
  /// ```
  /// use Lightstream::IntegerArray;
  /// let array = IntegerArray::from_vec(vec![1, 2, 3]);
  /// assert_eq!(array.len(), 3);
  /// ```
  pub fn from_vec(values: Vec<T>) -> Self { ... }
  ```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use property-based testing where appropriate
- Benchmark performance-critical code changes
- Test with both default and all features enabled

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- Create specific error types rather than using strings
- Provide helpful error messages
- Document error conditions in function documentation

## Types of Contributions

### Priority Areas

We particularly welcome contributions in these areas:

#### 1. Formats, Transports and Connectors
- File format support
- Readers/writers optimised for Lightstream types
- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, etc.)
- Cloud storage integrations (S3, GCS, Azure)

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation
   - Add changelog entry if applicable
   - Rebase on latest main branch

2. **Pull request description should include:**
   - Clear description of changes
   - Motivation for the changes
   - Testing performed
   - Breaking changes (if any)
   - Related issue numbers

3. **Review process:**
   - All PRs currently require approval from Peter Bower.
   - PR's will be reviewed within 7 days (usually sooner).
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Maintain discussion in PR comments

4. ### Licensing

- All contributions are accepted under the project’s MPL-2.0 licence.
- By submitting a contribution, you confirm that you have the legal right to do so and agree to the Contributor Licence Agreement (`CLA.md`).
- Please ensure no code is copied or derived from other repositories or source without appropriate rights or permissions.

### Review Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate:

- **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Performance**: Are there performance implications?
- **API Design**: Is the API intuitive and consistent?
- **Safety**: Does the code follow Rust safety principles?
- **Testing**: Are tests adequate and comprehensive?
- **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?

### Maintainer status
Regular high-quality contributions is likely to result in you being
granted maintainer status, with the ability to also approve PR's,
and contribute to the crate's direction.

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking

- Use `cargo bench` for performance testing
- Include baseline comparisons where relevant
- Test with realistic data sizes
- Consider both single-threaded and parallel scenarios

### Memory Management

- Maintain 64-byte alignment guarantees
- Minimise allocations in hot paths
- Use zero-copy operations except on trivial metadata fields
- Profile memory usage for large datasets

### SIMD Optimisation

- Ensure algorithms work with aligned data
- Test on multiple CPU architectures when possible
- Provide fallback implementations for unsupported features
- Document SIMD requirements clearly

## Feature Flags

When adding new features:

- Use feature flags for optional functionality
- Document feature dependencies clearly
- Ensure core functionality works without optional features
- Update CI to test relevant feature combinations

Example feature flag usage:
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "advanced_types")]
pub mod advanced {
    // Advanced type implementations
}
```

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- Major version: Breaking changes
- Minor version: New features, backwards compatible
- Patch version: Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` lives at the repo root and follows the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

As PRs merge, add a line to the `## [Unreleased]` section at the top of
`CHANGELOG.md`, under the relevant subsection:

- **Added** - new features and APIs
- **Changed** - changes in existing functionality (prefix breaking entries with
  `**Breaking:**`)
- **Deprecated** - APIs marked for removal in a future release
- **Removed** - APIs removed in this release
- **Fixed** - bug fixes
- **Security** - vulnerability fixes

Keep entries to user-facing changes. Internal refactors, CI tweaks, lint
passes, and test-only changes are normally omitted.

### Cutting a release

1. **Confirm `main` is green.** All three `features` matrix checks
   (`default`, `no-default-features`, `all-features`) must pass on the
   release commit.

2. **Finalise the changelog.** In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename
   `## [Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date), and open a
   fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` block above it. Add a compare link at the
   bottom:
   ```
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/pbower/Lightstream/compare/vx.y.z...HEAD
   [x.y.z]: https://github.com/pbower/Lightstream/compare/v<prev>...vx.y.z
   ```
   Update the existing `[Unreleased]` link's left side to `vx.y.z`.

3. **Bump the version.** Update `version = "x.y.z"` in `rust/Cargo.toml`, then run
   a build so `rust/Cargo.lock` updates:
   ```bash
   cd rust && cargo build --all-features
   ```

4. **Commit the release.** A single commit containing the `Cargo.toml`,
   `Cargo.lock`, and `CHANGELOG.md` changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/x.y.z
   git add rust/Cargo.toml rust/Cargo.lock CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Release x.y.z"
   git push -u origin release/x.y.z
   ```
   Open a PR, wait for CI, merge into `main`.

5. **Tag the merge commit on `main`.** Use an annotated tag and push it:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Lightstream x.y.z"
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

6. **Publish to crates.io:**
   ```bash
   cd rust && cargo publish
   ```

7. **Create the GitHub Release.** Mirror the `x.y.z` section from
   `CHANGELOG.md` into the release notes:
   ```bash
   gh release create vx.y.z --title "Lightstream x.y.z" --notes-file <(
     awk "/^## \\[x\\.y\\.z\\]/,/^## \\[/{print}" CHANGELOG.md | sed '$d'
   )
   ```
   Or paste the section by hand in the GitHub UI.

### Tags

Every release commit on `main` must carry an annotated tag `vx.y.z`
(e.g. `v0.11.0`). The compare links in `CHANGELOG.md` resolve against these
tags, and `cargo publish` records them as the source for crates.io / docs.rs.
