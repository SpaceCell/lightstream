//! # Chunked-file writer trait
//!
//! Common shape for the per-format chunked-file writers
//! (`ChunkedCsvWriter`, `ChunkedParquetWriter`, `ChunkedArrowWriter`):
//! a directory of `<base>-NNNNNNNNNN.<ext>` files produced one chunk per
//! call to [`Self::write_chunk`](crate::traits::chunked_table_writer::ChunkedTableWriter::write_chunk). Each emitted file is a complete,
//! independently readable file of the matching format, paired with the
//! matching `ChunkedXReader`.
//!
//! Per-format options are stored on the writer itself, so the trait
//! methods do not carry an `Options` parameter. Constructors stay
//! inherent on each writer, free to take exactly the args they need.
//!
//! `write_all` is the writer-side counterpart to
//! `crate::traits::chunked_table_reader::ChunkedTableReader::read_all`:
//! given a `SuperTable`, it writes every batch as its own chunk file in
//! order. `par_write_all` is the sync `std::thread::scope` fan-out where
//! workers reserve indices off the writer's shared atomic counter and
//! write each batch end-to-end via the writer's `write_chunk_at`. Index
//! reservation goes through the same counter as `write_chunk`, so the
//! two paths compose without producing duplicate filenames.
